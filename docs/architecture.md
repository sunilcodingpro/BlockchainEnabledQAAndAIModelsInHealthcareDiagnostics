- **Model Registry:** Registers models and stores metadata/hashes on blockchain.
- **Data Provenance:** Logs source and lineage of all samples used.
- **Decision Audit:** Stores AI/ML decisions and model explanations.
- **Explainability:** Provides SHAP and LIME explainability modules.
- **Regulatory Reporting:** Generates reports from blockchain records.
- **Simulation:** Test and simulate workflows end-to-end.
