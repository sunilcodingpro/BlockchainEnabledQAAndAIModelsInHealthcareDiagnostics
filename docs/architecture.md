# System Architecture

This document describes the comprehensive architecture for the Blockchain-Enabled QA and AI Models in Healthcare Diagnostics framework.

## Overview

The framework provides a complete solution for regulatory-compliant, auditable, and explainable AI/ML models in healthcare diagnostics, leveraging blockchain technology for trust and provenance.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Blockchain Layer
- **Technology:** Hyperledger Fabric
- **Components:**
  - `chaincode.py`: Smart contracts for model registry, diagnostics, drift detection, and compliance
  - `hyperledger_connector.py`: Interface to Hyperledger Fabric network
- **Purpose:** Immutable storage of model registrations, decisions, and audit trails

### 2. Framework Core Layer
- **Model Registry (`model_registry/`):**
  - Model registration with blockchain hashing
  - Version management and integrity verification
  - Model metadata and lifecycle tracking

- **Decision Audit (`decision_audit/`):**
  - Comprehensive logging of AI/ML decisions
  - Explainability information storage
  - Audit trail generation and querying

- **Data Provenance (`data_provenance/`):**
  - Healthcare-compliant data tracking
  - Anonymization and privacy protection
  - Data lineage and transformation logging

- **Explainability (`explainability/`):**
  - SHAP-based feature importance analysis
  - LIME local explanations
  - Model interpretation and visualization support

- **Regulatory Compliance (`regulatory/`):**
  - Automated report generation
  - Compliance assessment (HIPAA, GDPR, FDA AI guidelines)
  - Audit documentation

### 3. Application Layer
- **REST API (`backend/api.py`):**
  - Flask-based REST endpoints
  - Model registration and diagnostic submission
  - Audit trail querying and compliance reporting
  - Simulation orchestration

## Data Flow

1. **Model Registration:**
   ```
   Model File → Model Registry → Blockchain → Audit Trail
   ```
